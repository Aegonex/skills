description: Use the moment something happens in a session that git cannot reconstruct — the user makes a decision (what and why), an approach that was tried is abandoned, or an environment fact is learned (a command needs a flag or a variable, a tool is missing). Also use when the user says "จดไว้", "จำไว้ว่า", "ทางนี้ไม่ได้ผล", "ตัดสินใจแล้วว่า", "note this", "remember that". Not for progress reports or anything a commit already shows.

# aegonex-note

## Overview

Everything else is written at `aegonex-exit`. A session cut by a quota, a
crash or an automatic compaction never reaches exit, and what it decided
and tried is gone. This skill writes the three facts git cannot
reconstruct the moment they happen: one line, appended to `HANDOFF.md`,
no question asked, and the work continues.

Core principle: **a note that waits is as fragile as exit.** The write is
one line and git keeps it; asking first defeats the purpose.

## When to use

Two triggers, both first-class:
- **The agent notices** one of three things, in any message of the
  session, whether or not the user names this skill:
  - a decision: the user chose something, with a reason ("ใช้ 60s ไม่ต้อง
    configurable", "we'll keep jose");
  - a dead end: an approach was tried and abandoned, with why;
  - an environment fact: a command needs a flag or a variable, a tool is
    missing, a test needs a setup step.
- **The user says** "จดไว้", "จำไว้ว่า", "ทางนี้ไม่ได้ผล", "ตัดสินใจแล้วว่า",
  "note this", "remember that".

Not for: progress ("started X", "finished Y"), anything a commit or a diff
already shows, plans (`aegonex-plan`), or the end of the session
(`aegonex-exit`). A decision inside the user's instruction to do work
("use 60s, then continue") is still a decision: note it, then do the work.

## Procedure

1. Compose one line:
   `- <HH:MM> <decision|dead end|fact>: <text>`
   at most 120 characters, paths allowed, no code, in the user's language
   for the text. A decision carries its why in the same line.
2. Scan the line before writing:
   `grep -nEi 'KEY|TOKEN|SECRET|PASSWORD|Bearer|sk-[A-Za-z0-9]|ghp_|xox[a-z]-|AKIA|[A-Za-z0-9_/+=-]{32,}'`
   A hit becomes `<redacted>`; the fact around it stays ("the shell exports
   the prod token by mistake; use JWT_SECRET=dev"). A prefix or suffix of a
   secret is a secret.
3. Append the line under `## Session log` at the end of `HANDOFF.md`:
   - the section exists: append the line after its last line;
   - the section is missing: append `\n## Session log\n` and the line;
   - `HANDOFF.md` is missing: create a shell containing only
     `# HANDOFF — <today>`, a blank line, `Branch: <git branch --show-current> · HEAD: <git rev-parse --short HEAD>`,
     a blank line, `## Session log`, and the line. Exit still owns the file
     and will overwrite it.
   Nothing else in the file changes: not Stopped at, not Next step, not a
   character above the section.
4. Reply with exactly one line, `noted: <the line written>`, and continue
   whatever the user asked for. No question, no summary. If the user's
   message also asked for work, the `noted:` line comes first and the work
   follows in the same reply.
5. When the section now has twelve or more lines, add one more reply line:
   `session log is long: run aegonex-exit`.

Reads: the tail of `HANDOFF.md`, `git branch --show-current`,
`git rev-parse --short HEAD`. Writes: one line. Never `ROADMAP.md`, never
`AGENTS.md`, never code, never another section of `HANDOFF.md`.

What the other skills do with the log: `aegonex-exit` folds each line into
Decisions, Dead ends or Notes for the next session and drops the section;
`aegonex-init` reads a surviving section as proof that the last session
ended without exit.

## Never

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll record it in ROADMAP's Decisions, that is where decisions live" | Plan and exit write ROADMAP. A note is one line in HANDOFF; exit moves it. |
| "I'll ask whether they want it noted" | The line costs nothing and git keeps it. Asking is the failure the skill exists to prevent. |
| "I'll note it at exit with everything else" | Exit may never run. Now. |
| "It is obvious from the code" | The why is never in the code. |
| "I'll tidy the rest of HANDOFF while I'm there" | One line, one section. |

## Red flags — stop, you are leaving the procedure

- A `ROADMAP.md` edit in a message that is not `aegonex-plan`,
  `aegonex-exit` or `aegonex-done`.
- A reply that starts with anything but `noted:` when a decision was just
  made.
- Two lines written for one fact.
- A question mark in the reply.

## Quick reference

| Situation | Note does |
|---|---|
| "ตัดสินใจแล้วว่า X เพราะ Y ทำต่อเลย" | `noted: - HH:MM decision: X, เพราะ Y`, then the work |
| Approach A failed, switching to B | `noted: - HH:MM dead end: A, <why>` before B starts |
| A test needed `JWT_SECRET=dev` | `noted: - HH:MM fact: npm test needs JWT_SECRET=dev` |
| Text contains a token | the token becomes `<redacted>`, the fact stays |
| No `HANDOFF.md` yet | the shell is created with only the header and the log |
| Twelfth line | the `run aegonex-exit` hint is added |
